# mapping-balkans-in-data
Code for my side project: "Mapping Balkans in data". 

My goal is to look at different sociological, geographical and infrastructure factors and to make a good data visualization out of it. The data is downloaded from [The World Bank][1]. 

Since there are [numerous definitions of the Balkan teritory][2], it should be emphasized that this projects uses data of the following countries and territories: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia.
