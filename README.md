# mapping-balkans-in-data
Code for my side project: "Mapping Balkans in data". 

My goal is to look at different sociological, geographical and infrastructure factors, make good data visualizations and then apply couple of machine learning methods to predict, for example, immigrations/emmigrations, trends in education, travelling etc. The data is downloaded from [The World Bank][1]. 

NOTE: Since there are [numerous definitions of the Balkan teritory][2], it should be emphasized that this projects uses data of the following countries and territories: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo*, Montenegro, Northern Macedonia, Serbia and Slovenia.
